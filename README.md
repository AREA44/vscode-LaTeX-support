This extension adds syntax highlighting and snippets for LaTeX language. Originally converted from the [LaTeX TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/latex.tmbundle). I developed based on [area/language-latex](https://github.com/area/language-latex) and [James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop).

* Syntax highlighting for `BibTeX`, `LaTeX` and `TeX` language.
* Folding regions have markers defined: `%Region` and `%Endregion`.
* Snippets.
