**From VSCode 1.64, the VS Code team has decided to provide built-in support for the LaTeX grammar. So this extension only supports VSCode <1.64.**

This extension adds syntax highlighting and snippets for `LaTeX` language. I developed based on [VSCode LaTeX grammars](https://github.com/jlelong/vscode-latex-basics).

## Features
* Syntax highlighting for `BibTeX`, `LaTeX` and `TeX` language.
* Folding regions have markers defined: `%Region` and `%Endregion`.
* Snippets.
